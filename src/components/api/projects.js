New features will include an intelligent chatbot that assists customers with product recommendations, answering FAQs, and guiding them through the checkout process. Additionally, I will introduce more payment options, including PayPal along with using Stripe, which will make transactions even easier for users across the globe. The integration of multi-currency support is also in the works to cater to an international audience. I will also allow users to sign up using social media accounts such as their Google account. In this project, I will be experimenting with Tailwind CSS and hope to get a good grasp of the main concepts whilst building this web application.',
